# Rainfall-Analysis
This Python script generates a detailed Excel report analyzing and visualizing various aspects of rainfall data.

### The report includes:
 - Original Rainfall Data: Graphically represented by daily rainfall, classified in 5mm/day increments.
 - One Day Analysis: Shows occurrence, exceedance, rate, and probability with accompanying graphs for Rainfall Occurrence and Rainfall Probability.
 - One Day Probability Data Frame: Presents return period, one-day probability, and a Probability of Rainfall Event graph.
 - Gumbel Estimate: Details maximum one-day rainfall, observations, rankings, and statistical estimates with graphs.
 - Gumbel Estimate and Full Series: Compares return period and variables with a graph.
 - Residual Mass: Displays yearly total rainfall and other related metrics with graphs.
 - Monthly Rainfall (Box and Whisker): Lists monthly data with box and whisker and total monthly rainfall graphs.
 - Log Pearson (III): Provides statistical calculations and a Log Pearson (III) Estimate graph.
 - GEV and MEV: Includes statistical parameters and starting guesses for MEV.
 - LP (III) Estimate: Contains detailed statistical calculations and a comparative graph for all estimates.
 - This script provides a comprehensive analysis of rainfall data, facilitating in-depth understanding and decision-making.
